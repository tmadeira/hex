This is an implementation of the Hex board game. According to Wikipedia,

> Hex is a strategy board game for two players played on a hexagonal grid, theoretically of any size and several possible shapes, but traditionally as an 11Ã—11 rhombus. Players alternate placing markers or stones on unoccupied spaces in an attempt to link their opposite sides of the board in an unbroken chain. One player must win; there are no draws. The game has deep strategy, sharp tactics and a profound mathematical underpinning related to the Brouwer fixed-point theorem. It was invented in the 1940s independently by two mathematicians, Piet Hein and John Nash. The game was first marketed as a board game in Denmark under the name Con-tac-tix, and Parker Brothers marketed a version of it in 1952 called Hex; they are no longer in production. Hex can also be played with paper and pencil on hexagonally ruled graph paper.

You can find (or create) different players (e.g. random, minimax algorithm using alpha-beta pruning) in `src/players`.

You can change the board size and the players in the game in `src/App.js`. By default, the game is 9x9 and the players are a human (player 1, red) and a minimax AI using the heuristic function in `algorithms/smallest.js` (player 2, blue).
